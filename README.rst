== Kong ==

Kong is a simple interface to Kongregate (http://www.kongregate.com/)
statistics. It was originally written to provide 360 Kid-style statistics
reporting, as a small boredom-based project, and has not really grown since
its inception.

=== Usage ===

To be decided. Library and executable usage still need to be split out.

=== Bugs ===

No bugs currently known. Feel free to email the author or open new bugs on
github.

=== License ===

Kong is currently unlicensed, but this will be fixed shortly.
